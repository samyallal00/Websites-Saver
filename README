WHAT IS IT?
  - Do you have multiple tabs open in your browser?
  - Is that killing your system's performance and RAM usage?
  - But, you still would like to keep all your tabs?

  This program is right for you!

  It allows you to store your links all together under one topic of your
  choice. You could have multiple topics, and in each topic multiple links.

  Each topic opens up in a new window in your browser.
  All links open up as multiple tabs in a window.


EXAMPLE:

  Add topic: WORK
  Add links: <link1>, <link2>, <link3>

  Open browser: WORK
  ^^ Opens a new window in your default browser with three tabs
     <link1>, <link2>, and <link3> ^^


MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES:
  1. Add new topics and new links.
  2. Delete existing links individually.
  3. Open up a list of links by selecting the topic.


TWO VERSIONS:
  1. Terminal
  2. GUI (Much better)

NOTE:
  - Currently set to work on MacOS, need to modify path in backend.py
    to your default web browser path.

DEPENDENCIES:

  1. Python3 (webbrowser comes with Python3)
  2. tkinter module
